<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
  I'm Qaisar, your app developer. I sculpt pixels into front-end landscapes and forge backend logic into steel beams, crafting seamless experiences that feel as natural as a sunrise.
</p>

<p>
  With a dynamic background in both software development and agriculture, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and industry experience. As a dedicated Software Developer, I've developed extensive knowledge in:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Software Development, Object-Oriented Programming, Pair-Programming, Test-driven development</li>
  <li>Frontend: Front End Design, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript/React, Redux, API, Frameworks, Bootstrap</li>
  <li>Backend: Database-PostgreSQL, Ruby on Rails, Unit Testing, Deployment, Maintenance</li>
  <li>Test Driven Development: RSpec, Capybara and Jest</li>
  <li>Tools & Methods: Git, GitHub</li>
  <li>Landscape Engineering: AutoCAD, Adobe Photoshop, Premier, 3D Realtime Landscape, PunchPro</li>
  <li>Communication skills: Bridging Cultural Canyons and building bridges of understanding between diverse teams. No matter the language or culture, I weave clear communication tapestries that foster collaboration and synergy.</li>
  <li>Time management: Tasks, time zones, and time itself, I keep everything spinning with a smile, ensuring seamless collaboration even when the clock hands spin at different speeds.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In the past two years, I've embarked on a thrilling journey to become a well-rounded full-stack developer. It hasn't been just about mastering technologies; I've actively honed my communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills to be a valuable asset to any team. I've built over 15-20 impressive projects, both solo and collaboratively, showcasing my diverse skillset across the tech stacks of HTML/CSS, Ruby/Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React, and Redux.
</p>

<p>
  I consistently exceeded expectations during my time at Microverse, attaining a remarkable 97.6% project completion rate and scoring a stellar 43.9 out of 45 on the final assessment. This achievement reflects my technical prowess, meticulous work ethic, and unwavering commitment to excellence.
</p>

<p>
  I'm always eager to learn, experiment, and grow, embracing every opportunity to contribute meaningfully to the tech world. If you'd like to get in contact about potential job opportunities, please reach out! or I love talking with other devs, feel free to connect if you'd like to chat.
